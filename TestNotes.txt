Tools for testing node app-
Mocha and chai.

Chai comes with assertion libs. like expect(fn call).to.be.()
it('name of test',() => {

})

For stubing the rest calls or db operations we can stub it.

To prevent hoisting use the - use 'strict mode'
this will make js code to execute in that order strictly.
